Although trading in the shares of the VOC began in 1609 on the Amsterdam exchange, an upstart rival, the Imperial India company of Antwerp publically offered their shares in 1723, and quickly sold out to eager investors seeking to participate in Asian trade. The capital raised by the Imperial India Company financed extraordinarily profitable voyages to China where the firm's merchants traded for casks of Chinese tea, fine silks and other exotica. Success was short-lived however. In 1727 the company's charter was suspended by the preliminary Treaty of Paris and in 1731 the company was outlawed by the Second Treaty of Vienna. The dates you see on the stock certificate show that subscribers paid-up in stages as capital was needed. It may also have ben a means by which shareholders partially protected themselves against bankruptcy",

Subscription of the Town of Portsmouth as Proprietor of a Share in the Piscataqua Bridge. At the time it was built, in 1794, the Piscataqua Bridge, built between Dover and Newington across the “Great Bay of the Piscataqua River” was an enormous engineering feat. Its builder, Timothy Palmer, had designed what was to be the longest span bridge in the world. As our newly established nation was beginning to develop and build, NH took a leading role in the incorporation of bridge companies. In December of 1792, a petition was submitted for this important bridge to be built and in 1793 the NH legislatures granted petitioners the exclusive right of building this toll bridge over the Piscataqua River. The subscription of 500 shares was filled at Portsmouth, numerous shares being taken by Bostonian men. The town of Portsmouth subscribed 1000 pounds. “The total bridge was 2,360 feet long and 38-feet wide. Palmer designed and built a main span over the navigable channel of 244 feet. The water at the bridge site was about 52-feet deep, thus requiring major falsework. Prior to this he had the deck resting on the bottom chord of the truss with overhead bracing. At Piscataqua he introduced another tier of timber located near the top of the truss on which the deck was placed and put bracing under the deck. His top chord, in addition to its contribution to the truss, was also the bridge railing. He ordered timbers up to 16 x 18-inches in sections,  over 50-feet long with a natural curvature to match the curvature of his three chord members.” – [Timothy Palmer, The Nestor of American Bridge Builders, Griggs.)]",

Under the directive of Pope Leo X, who was also a De Medici, these banks changed their purpose and accepted deposits on a commercial interest bearing basis to loan to the state or for a specific purpose. The real commercialization of these banks began under Ferdinand de Medici, under whose auspices this bond was issued to offer interest bearing bonds to Investors. It paid an interest of 4% per annum and is quite decorative with the Medici Coat-of-Arms (with six spheres, which inspired the symbols outside today’s pawn shops) flanked by two representation of Jesus with six loaves of bread. _x000B_",

    "title": "The Caracas Company, the Real Compania Guipuzcoana de Caracas",
    "description": "MADRID. 1 June 1752. Accion de 500 escudos. black. #2000. No 2530. The 'Caracas Company', the Real Compania Guipuzcoana de Caracas, was formed by a group of merchants in the Guipuzcoa province, around San Sebastian, in the Basque region of Spain, to trade with the Caracas province of Venezuela, with the further aims of (a) developing its agriculture, especially cocoa, and (b) keeping watch on the coast, from the mouth of the river Orinoco to the river Hacha (later extended to cover Maracaibo). This latter aim was to prevent illegal (in Spanish eyes) trading, particularly by the Dutch from Curaçao. The leader of this group was the Count of Penaflorida. This was the first of the great Spanish overseas trading companies, and the first Spanish trading company known to have issued shares to the general public. The company had the right to send two ships per year from San Sebastian and nearby Pasajes to Venezuela, carrying all types of Spanish goods. For the return voyage the ships brought precious metals, cocoa, sugar, tobacco and leathers, back to Sevilla and, later, Cadiz. In 1730 the company set about establishing a chain of trading-posts along the coast of what is now Venezuela and the offshore islands of Margarita and Trinidad, and in 1732 obtained a monopoly of trade between Caracas and Spain; in 1742 this was extended for an indefinite period. In that same year the company's Head Office was moved from San Sebastian to Madrid. From the outset the company was very profitable, paying large dividends to its shareholders. King Felipe V and the Queen took 100 shares each, for a combined investment of 100,000 escudos. The initial capital was 1,000,000 escudos (2,000 shares of 500 escudos of 15 reales each), but shares were a new idea to the Spanish public, and they did not sell well at first; only 500,000 escudos were sold (including those to the royal house, as above). The capital was later increased, in 1752, and again in 1766. The company's activities expanded rapidly, especially after 1734, when restrictions on the number of sailings were removed. The Caracas production, especially of cocoa, rose sharply. By mid-century the company owned 12 large ocean-going ships and 19 coastal ships, with some 2,500 crew, and carrying 2,500 or more tons of freight annually in each direction. However, the company mis-used its monopoly powers, by charging excessive prices for imported goods, and cutting steadily the already low prices paid to Caracas growers for their produce; this, together with interference in the government of Caracas, led in the end to a rebellion by the the colonists. Not until 1752 was this finally subdued, and these events led the Spanish government to reduce the company's privileges and introduce fixed prices for buying cocoa and other produce. Profits fell sharply, and the company's fortunes went into steady decline. Its investments in Spain were unsuccessful; wars against England in 1761-3 and 1779-83 cost it dearly; the free-trading policies of King Carlos III were the final blow. In 1781 the company lost the monopoly with Venezuela, and in 1785 it was absorbed by the Real Compania de Filipinas. The Caracas shares were exchanged for those of the Filipinas company. The share is very attractive, printed on vellum, with a fine copper-engraving. At the top are the royal arms of Guipuzcoa; on each side, and down the sides is a fine design of leaves, fruit,weapons, and an Indian man, with bow-and-arrow, and woman. Boxes of company freight are all around. There is a fine paper seal, also with the royal arms of Guipuzcoa. This is a share from the fist capital increase.",

    "description": "Dated September 5, 1795 HARTFORD. Certificate of 3000 Founders' Shares. A very important company in the histories of Connecticut and Ohio, founder of the city of Cleveland and once owner of much of the State of Ohio. A grant from the English King Charles II in 1662 had given to Connecticut the title to all the territory between 41 and 42.2 degrees North in a band across the whole of America to the Pacific, some of this conflicting with rights also given to Pennsylvania. In 1763 the British government designated all lands east of the Appalachians and west of the Mississippi to be an Indian Reserve, so blocking the western expansion of all the colonies, and this was one of the grievances leading to the War of Independence. By the Treaty of Paris that ended the hostilities in 1783, Britain ceded the Indian Reserve to the United States. In the subsequent negotiations amongst the states, Connecticut ceded to Pennsylvania in the east and to the federal government in the west most of its 41st Parallel claim, retaining an area 120 miles wide to the west of Pennsylvania, later called the Connecticut Western Reserve (separated by several hundred miles from Connecticut). In 1795 a group of investors paid the State $1,200,000 for the Western Reserve and formed themselves into the Connecticut Land Company with 1,200,000 shares. The largest shareholder was Oliver Phelps, a major speculator in western New York lands also, who subscribed for 168,000 shares in his sole name and another 80,000 jointly with a partner. In 1796 the company began the development of what was to become the State of Ohio. They sent Moses Cleaveland to survey the Reserve and lay out townships, amongst others the foundations of the city of Cleveland, and set about selling land to settlers from the East. In 1800 Connecticut ceded sovereignty over the Western Reserve and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory, then in 1803 became the north-east part of the State of Ohio. Issued to Calvin Austin, and an attached manuscript transfer of the shares to James K Garnsey for a price of $8,000 dated 20th December 1796.",

        "description": "Page 1 of 4 -  Dated September 5, 1795 HARTFORD. Certificate of 3000 Founders' Shares. A very important company in the histories of Connecticut and Ohio, founder of the city of Cleveland and once owner of much of the State of Ohio. A grant from the English King Charles II in 1662 had given to Connecticut the title to all the territory between 41 and 42.2 degrees North in a band across the whole of America to the Pacific, some of this conflicting with rights also given to Pennsylvania. In 1763 the British government designated all lands east of the Appalachians and west of the Mississippi to be an Indian Reserve, so blocking the western expansion of all the colonies, and this was one of the grievances leading to the War of Independence. By the Treaty of Paris that ended the hostilities in 1783, Britain ceded the Indian Reserve to the United States. In the subsequent negotiations amongst the states, Connecticut ceded to Pennsylvania in the east and to the federal government in the west most of its 41st Parallel claim, retaining an area 120 miles wide to the west of Pennsylvania, later called the Connecticut Western Reserve (separated by several hundred miles from Connecticut). In 1795 a group of investors paid the State $1,200,000 for the Western Reserve and formed themselves into the Connecticut Land Company with 1,200,000 shares. The largest shareholder was Oliver Phelps, a major speculator in western New York lands also, who subscribed for 168,000 shares in his sole name and another 80,000 jointly with a partner. In 1796 the company began the development of what was to become the State of Ohio. They sent Moses Cleaveland to survey the Reserve and lay out townships, amongst others the foundations of the city of Cleveland, and set about selling land to settlers from the East. In 1800 Connecticut ceded sovereignty over the Western Reserve and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory, then in 1803 became the north-east part of the State of Ohio. Issued to Calvin Austin, and an attached manuscript transfer of the shares to James K Garnsey for a price of $8,000 dated 20th December 1796."

    "title": "Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations",
    "description": "Mortgage bond for 75 pounds Dated 1738.  Text partly written (hard to read) but mainly printed (easily legible). The colony government, sitting at Newport, raised, through the 6th landbank, a 5% loan of £100.000 in 1738, being the 12th year of the reign of King George II. Repayment was to follow 25 years later. The underlying mortgage had to be double the face value of the bond. The bond was issued to Edward Arnold, a great grandson of William Arnold who was one of the 13 original colonists of Providence (Indian purchase). On behalf of the Colony, a panel of 6 strustees acted for the general assembly of that colony, called the Grand Committee. These men were John Wanton, George Goulding, Jahleel Brenton, Daniel Updike, John Gardner and Jahleel Brenton. Signed by Edward Arnold (with a tiny part of his wax seal remaining), Joseph Potter, John Warner, Ezekiel Warner and Richard Waterman. A 2008 Princeton University study about taxation in colonial America (by A. Rabushka) states that \"the interest paid by the borrowers was sufficient to pay the entire cost of the colony's government during the era of saultary neglect\". This is by far the oldest scripophily we have ever offered from what would later became the United States. Of great historic interest. This was a time when the various colonies in New England were issuing new loans in a paper currency which was steadily depreciating in value, to become almost worthless in time. The price of silver, as the only reliable store of value, rose regularly, in terms of the colonial currency._x000B_Rhode island’s large issues of paper money and their subsequent depreciation led Parliament in 1751 to enact a ban on the issue of all new paper money in the New England colonies (and subsequently, in 1764, in all the remaining colonies)._x000B_Rhode Island’s first paper money, issued in 1710, was fiat currency backed by future taxes.8 Its subsequent issues were mainly loan-office disbursements for 10-year mortgage loans at 5 percent interest. Interest on the first loan was earmarked for the repair of Fort Ann. This loan was known as the First Bank._x000B_A subsequent issue in 1715, re-dated 1721, known as the Second Bank, was extended for five years, with interest payable in flax and hemp. These loans were later extended to 23 years in duration. The Third Bank, approved in 1728, issued £49,000 to replace all prior issues and provide funds for further repair of Fort Ann. The Fourth Bank (1734) issued £60,000 at 5 percent interest as 10-year delayed mortgage loans. The Fifth Bank (1733) issued £104,000, with interest earmarked for cannon at Fort George. The Sixth Bank (1738) issued £100,000 for 20-year mortgages at 5 percent interest. The Seventh Bank (1740) issued £24,000 on 20 years at 4 percent. The Eighth Bank (1743) issued £40,000 on similar terms._x000B_Due to these large issues, in contrast with the middle colonies, Rhode Island notes did not maintain their value. Depreciation of Rhode Island currency resulted in the creation of notes designated New Tenor, each of which was worth four times the previous issues, the Old Tenor notes. The Ninth Bank (1750) issued £50,000 New Tenor notes in five-year mortgages at 6 percent interest; a year later the loans were doubled in duration and the interest reduced to 5 percent._x000B_Rhode Island loan offices did not directly re-lend repaid bills. Rather, each time the currency in circulation declined due to repayment, a new bank was authorized and its issue of bills increased the total supply of money in circulation compared with authorization of the prior bank. The nominal value of Rhode Island paper money for each 1,000 persons peaked at £31,500 Rhode Island currency in 1760, but its real exchange rate value amounted to £59 English sterling. This was a decline from a peak of £166 English sterling in 1740 when £18,300 Rhode Island currency circulated for each 1,000 population. Between 1740 and 1760, the quantity of local currency per 1,000 population had risen 72 percent, while its value in English sterling had declined 64 percent._x000B_Despite the steady depreciation of Rhode Island bills, the colony’s legislature authorized one issue after another because the interest paid by the borrowers was sufficient to pay the cost of Rhode Island government during some peacetime years. This eliminated or reduced the need to impose provincial taxes, a measure popular with the taxpaying electorate._x000B_",

    "description": "Monte di Pieta were founded in a number of European cities as Christian charities and leading securities. In 1624, the Monte di Pieta in Florence began to issue interest-bearing bonds. This Monte Di Pieta bond was issued in 1627, and it promised to pay teh buyer an interest rate of 4.5% per year. The decoration shows the figure of Christ dispersing loaves of bread - a symbol of the original, charitable purpose of the organization. The central symbol is the crest of the Medici family, the longtime rulers of Florence in the Renaissance era, leaving little doubt regarding the guarantors of the loan.  In the first line of the bond is the term \"non vacabile\" which indicates that the interest payents were not limited in terms to the life of the bondholder and could be transferred. Monte Di Pieta banks have continued to operate in Italy to the present day.",
